# Twilio Programmable Video Rest API using Django

This rest api was made after carefully going through the docs and integrating the server part using python django-rest-framework, as there are close to none rest apis for Twilio Video in django.

There are a few changes that needs to be done before deploying so beaware of that.

Anybody who wants to use my rest-api is welcome to do so!
